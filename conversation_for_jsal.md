## Questions
- It's easy to create single embedding points which represent snapshots of data. Using this embedding space we need to figure out how to use hundrends to millions of embedding points to generate large structure's that represnt knowledge effectively.
- How much new knowledge do these 5 papers add to our net new knowledge? (I.E. given the shape of our current knowledge and the same of these cumulative additional 5 papers what is the net news knowledge being added?)
