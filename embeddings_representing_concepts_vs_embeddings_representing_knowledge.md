What we are calling "knowledge" right now really just "concept"

Concept
Knowledge
Analysis
Synthesis
Understanding
Reasoning

So when we get an embedding back really what we have at that point is coordinate point that corresponds to this concept

A concept operation

Is concept A within concept B?
Concept example
- A screw
- A bolt
- A piece of plastic

Knowledge example
- How to constrcut this dinousaur toy

This creates the problem of when I say...
```
- You'll be able to view the new knowledge of a new research paper with this command `know subtract paper-A.know all-my-research.know | know view`
```
What will actually be viewed is the differrence in concepts space not knowledge space
The embedding space does comproise some knowledge

In order to represent concepts appropriately the underlying knowledge must be already integrated into the fabric of the concepts

Now, also worth looking at... is that a research paper will layout a chain of reasoning. It will already assume some existing knowledge. It will provide additional information, analysis, and synthesis often resulting in a new conclusion

In the example below the concept "programming languages" has a wide area but there isn't much density to it. Is "python" "javascript" "java" new knowledge? Conceptually is already contained in all-my-research but not at a deeper level
------
Command    : `know subtract paper-A.know                   all-my-research.know`
Actual Data:               "python, javascript, java"     "...programming languages..."
------
