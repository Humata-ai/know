## About

The ambition of this project is to create a knowledge API capable of responding to complex knowledge queries with traceability and human interpretability.

Think of it as a fusion between LLMs, which can answer complex human questions, and Git, which can model representational version changes.

## Approach

The fundamental approach is around building a concept map in geometric space that accurately represents the underlying fundamental knowledge.

## Real World Examples
### Solving the Retrieval Accuracy Problem in Document-Based RAG Pipelines

A primary application of Know is to address the retrieval accuracy problem in document-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

The main quality challenge in RAG systems today lies in retrieval intelligence — that is, how effectively the system can identify and surface the precise knowledge needed to generate a correct and complete answer.

Key questions include:
- Given a user’s query, how accurately can the retrieval system find the relevant knowledge?
- If the knowledge is missing, does the system recognize that?
- If the knowledge is partial, does it understand the incompleteness?
- If the knowledge exceeds the context window, does the system handle that intelligently?
- Can the retrieval system aggregate and synthesize information that is distributed across large or disjointed sections of documents?

For example:
- Can it return a summary of a book?
- Can it produce a synthesis of how a new piece of legislation impacts a business agreement?

### A research tool
Since the nature of Know is interoperable and explainable it's a great fit for researchers and decision makers because built into the fabric of the technology is explainability and interpretability. Questions like "What sources make this answer true?" are easily surfaceable and findable. Additionally, exploration and searchability become simple because nearby concepts are immediately viewable.

### Mapping a codebase for improved retrival of a coding agent
When the concepts of a codebase can be accurately mapped this will improve performance of AI coding agents by enhancing there ability to search, understand, and make proper changes to the correct sections of large codebases
